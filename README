        NOTE:
        1. setup.sh and cleanup.sh are optional
        2. test cases must start with prefix "tc_"
           which is by design (pls refer to run_tests.sh)
        3. Currently Makefile templates are not well drafted, hence you
           don't have to write Makefile

Q: How to run?
A: Easy, e.g.

        bash$ bash ./run_tests.sh -e -T tests/demo
        OR
        bash$ make && ./run -e -T tests/demo


OR (run a single case)

        bash$ bash tests/demo/tc_demo_pos001.sh

SIDES:
        To make your shell code clean, please always check your code via tool
        "sandbox/tools/icat"
        e.g.
        bash$ sandbox/tools/icat -c tests/demo/*.sh
        [ PASS ] check file tests/demo/cleanup.sh
        [ PASS ] check file tests/demo/setup.sh
        [ PASS ] check file tests/demo/tc_demo_pos001.sh
        [ PASS ] check file tests/demo/tc_demo_pos002.sh
